## Profile

I am a former special education teacher, excited to begin a career in UX design with a drive for learning. I attended Makers Academy - a 16 week development bootcamp. During those 16 weeks I have developed a passion for Object Oriented Design, Test Driven Development and coding. However, what most excites me most is melding my former experience, to hunt for answers on the user behind the screen...

- **[Time for an adventure](www.google.com)**
  - A Web app where users can create and play choose your own adventure stories.
Demonstration of the application - [Demo on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4NPua1kmD0).  
  - My contribution to this project was primarily to construct a clean UI for creating your own stories


## <a name="skills">Skills</a>
**:date: Application Design and Project Management**
+ Drawing Wireframes for final project to guide ticket order and collaboration between the back and front end (Add link)

+ Analysing the boundaries between intuitive satisfying design and what is technically feasible in a given time frame  

+ Creating and Managing tickets for working effectively as a team by sorting tickets in order of dependency

+ Daily Stand ups, facilitating communication reflecting on team dynamics and personal development

**:books: Fast Learner**
<!-- maybe mention full stack, MVC, request response relationships here?? -->
+  Over the period of 16 weeks at Makers Academy I learnt and utilised new technologies to create web apps: Ruby,  Javascript, JQuery, Ruby on Rails, Node.js and SQL all put together with test driven development

+  Assigned to a classroom where a form of sign language, known as Makaton, was used to communicate with children. Sink or Swim, it was essential I catch up to a certain standard to communicate effectively. Thankfully I swam.

+ Taking a support role at a high support facility for males diagnosed with severe ill-mental health... Yup. Lots of responsibility and pressure to adapt in a short space of time

**:sparkling_heart: People Person**
+  Working in the social sector for the last 3 years, with children with learning disabilities and adults with ill-mental health, I have developed a keen sense for empathising with service users.

+  I love figuring out how people react and how to adapt to the situation. When working with non-verbal children with severe autism, we spent everyday monitoring, breaking down and implementing solutions to adjust to each child's behaviour.

+  The goal is to combine the best of both bringing people and technology together
